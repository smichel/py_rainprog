	abstract = "Cartesian coordinates are a fundamental concept in mathematics and are central to computer graphics. Such rectangular coordinates are just offsets relative to some origin. Other coordinate systems also exist such as polar, spherical and cylindrical coordinates, and they, too, require an origin. Barycentric coordinates, on the other hand, locate points relative to existing points, rather than to an origin and are known as local coordinates. The German mathematician August M{\"o}bius (1790--1868) is credited with their discovery.",

It also discusses computations for convergence from geographic positions and from grid coordinates for the UTM grid, and convergence in the Polar Stereographic projection. Both mathematical and tabular methods are illustrated for the above items. A discussion of scale corrections is included. Transformations between the two grids, the Military Grid Reference System and the World Geographic Reference System are discussed. Finally, datum transformation methods, formulas and definitions are illustrated. Diagrams, textual information and software are provided. All software for grid calculations, including thos from manual DMA TM 8358.1, are included as ANNEXES A and B.",
